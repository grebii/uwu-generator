# uwu-generator
it makes the  
the text uwu like
this "Hewwo! UwU"

you need cargo/rustup
https://rustup.rs/

after you have cargo installed  

install it like this I think `
cargo install --git https://github.com/grebii/uwu-generator/
`

and run it in the terminal like this `uwu` or `cargo uwu` (I don't know if you nedd to put cargo first or not,,, you'll figure it out!)

by default it will use whatever is in
your
clipboard if you want to  
to not do that
do this `uwu "my cool text"`
